					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/staff.library.ucsf.edu/2015/03/18/library-news-gets-a-facelift/#comment-476&quot;&gt;Anneliese Taylor&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for the feedback. The design is not custom, but controlled by a theme that is applied to the site. We aimed for something visual (some will see the image but not read the text) and clean that would work across most screen sizes. Of course, nothing is perfect in all situations, so your comments will be helpful if we change that theme down the road.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The new News program is very nice visually. I always find the image on the full news item though to take up too much of the screen on my desktop. For example, https://news.library.ucsf.edu/2015/07/psychiatryonline-now-available/ - it takes up 3/4 of the page, and the byline is at the very bottom of the screen. I feel like the image should take up much less of the screen, and there should be more content in view before requiring any scrolling.

Looking on my mobile device (iPhone 4), I have to scroll to get past the image, and the width of the image does not fit in my viewing screen (though the text wraps nicely). Looking at the ocular prosthetic news item https://news.library.ucsf.edu/2015/08/artificial-eyes-on-the-5th-floor/, there is text on the right side of the image that is cut off on my mobile phone, and I cannot resize the image to fully view it.]]></description>
