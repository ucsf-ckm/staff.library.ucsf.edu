Excellent job Michele, Tab, Andy, and Jason! 

I appreciate how much time, thought, and effort you all put in to make the trial go smoothly. Both you and Tab were so quick to respond to investigate issues and functionality that we got to experience Zendesk&#039;s real potential. It&#039;s ok to have room for improvement--the key for me is Zendesk works well as it is in its current form.]]></description>
