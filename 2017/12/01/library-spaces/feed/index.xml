As for stickers ... Kemi and Kirk are working on new signage, but I don&#039;t know what the rollout looks like.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks.  

Maybe I may have missed the &quot;Noise&quot; policy...but it&#039;s nice to know that feature is added to the filter and it directs folks to that page.

It would also be great if &quot;Considerate Study&quot; stickers are placed on the doors of the group study rooms.  I sometimes would pass by the study room on the 4th floor and would hear students inside laughing and talking so loudly that others outside could easily hear their conversations.]]></description>

Thanks for that question, Gail.

We&#039;re limited to AND filtering because of development restrictions. Right now, we don&#039;t have the devpower to build a custom solution, so we used existing WordPress plugins and a sprinkling of dev magic from Stefan to get as far as we&#039;ve gotten. Out-of-the-box we could only select one filter at a time.

We think it&#039;s worth users having to back themselves out of a &#039;no results&#039; filter set to gain multi-filter functionality.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great new page! I was wondering about the decision to set up the filters to be “and” instead of “or”. By that I mean, if I select both ‘quiet’ and ‘considerate’ I get no results because it is only filtering for things that have both of those attributes.

Is this something you looked at in user testing? Or still playing with?]]></description>

Good point, Sean. We were concerned about that as well. We asked our testers (students, the main users of Library space) to define those terms for us. I was mildly surprised that 10/10 understood the difference between considerate (occasional, low-voiced talking but no ongoing conversation) and quiet. Interestingly, &#039;interactive&#039; was less easily understood than &#039;collaborative&#039;, so we switched to that term for &#039;feel free to make noise&#039;. We link to the precise definitions in the table: https://www.library.ucsf.edu/about/policies/noise/.]]></description>
