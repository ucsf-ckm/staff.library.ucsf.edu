					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/staff.library.ucsf.edu/2019/05/30/credit-bearing-and-continuing-education-ce-library-classes/#comment-860&quot;&gt;Haley Mcewan&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Haley,

That is correct- the School of Nursing CE Office charges $15 as an admin fee for processing the CE certificate. Students pay through the School of Nursing. The Library does not handle the transaction. The other professional schools (Med, Dent, Pharm) may charge other departments for sponsoring CEs, however, according to Tymothi Peters, I was told that the Library is &quot;educational&quot; and may have CE fees waived, especially since we are not allowed to charge students. There are other departments on campus that offer CEs and do not charge.

Any Credit-bearing class taught by Library Staff goes through a professional school or Graduate Division. The Library does not sponsor, nor charge for the class. My report points to other UC Libraries that have offered credit-bearing classes in the same way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Sofia,
As per the March 5th email, the library is prohibited from charging USCF students for classes as we are not an academic department.  There is currrently no mechanism for collecting money on a per head basis. $15 is untenable.  Have you discovered new information that the EVCP finance office isn&#039;t aware of?]]></description>
