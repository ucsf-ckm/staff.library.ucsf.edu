					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Rich - there&#039;s definitely many users out there who believe that once you log in through myaccess, you would have full access to library electronic journals.  I know I have received such calls at the front desk (&quot;what do you mean? i&#039;m already logged in through MyAccess!  I need to log out again?&quot;).  Is it possible to modify our remote access webpage to let users know that going directly to myaccess.ucsf.edu FIRST is not the proper method of access?  Thanks, Andy]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post Rich! So just to be sure I am on the same page the faculty member should either:


reload the page through the EZproxy bookmarklet (https://www.library.ucsf.edu/services/browsertools)



or 

navigate to the article via the library website




Right?]]></description>
