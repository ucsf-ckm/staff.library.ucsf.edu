OK, the erstwhile Databases box is now a News Items result box. Thanks for the feedback!]]></description>

It&#039;s important to make the things that people search most frequently for easily findable, but infrequently searched items on our web page also need to be findable. I like the idea of making news content searchable in a separate box or as a separate click, whichever works best.  Thanks!]]></description>

That&#039;s an interesting issue, and one we certainly thought about before making the change. This is one change, and certainly not the last change. If news items need more subtle treatment than what we&#039;re giving them now, that is something that can certainly be addressed.

For that particular news item, a search for Structural Equation Modeling wouldn&#039;t have turned it up on the old search. (We have the old search running on a dev server for now so we can compare results.) 

And while a search for various combinations of &quot;taylor&quot; and &quot;francis&quot; would find it, the site data shows that in the last 365 days, a search like that has occurred 13 times. In comparison, there were 352 searches for variations on &quot;cochrane&quot;, 176 searches for &quot;ipa&quot;, and 247 searches for &quot;scopus&quot;.

More subtle treatment of news items would require more time and more testing. But if news items add a lot of value for patrons in QuickSearch results, we can certainly work on that. One obvious possibility would be to put news items in the box on the right hand side that currently shows redundant Database results. (The issue with that box is that no one who isn&#039;t told that it&#039;s there actually ever notices it. But we can make changes there to try to make that more visible.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These changes look really nice and I think will help people hone in on resources and services more easily.
I do however think that not being to search the News items anywhere on the library web is a mistake. We put useful information that in many cases is relevant for longevity. The Taylor &#038; Francis journal package cancellation is a good example (http://www.library.ucsf.edu/content/changes-taylor-francis-journals-ucsf). This is the only place on our web site where we inform people of what went down with that publisher, and we need to be able to point people to it or have them find it on their own when they ask, what happened to Structural Equation Modeling?  Currently I have no way to find that page using Quicksearch, or even searching the News page. It took me some hunting and pecking to find where it was. 
How about including a &quot;Search News&quot; option in the Quick search results, that will run a separate search? If we&#039;re going to keep news items on the web for some amount of time, they need to be searchable.
Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great idea to use what look more like post-coordinated terms to display search results!  Finding lots of similar looking matches then having to wade through them to find relevant documents is not fun!  Much better to look at classes of results.

This makes things easier for information seekers, and as far as Mooers&#039; law (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooers%27_Law) holds for health sciences students here at UCSF, this will hopefully result in more happier searchers!]]></description>
