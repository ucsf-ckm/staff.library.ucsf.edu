					<description><![CDATA[Great idea to have a featured guide section, drawing attention to key wayfinding resources available at the library and encouraging information seekers to browse these.

I didn&#039;t have a chance to look at more than a small sample of the guides, however navigability and browsability might be improved if there was more consistency across guides&#039; homepages.

Each person who curates content for a particular area needs to think about that area in highlighting important information, and that makes sense.  The templates being the same across guides makes differences in the content of the central panel particularly jarring when browsing though.

Definitely increased the visibility of these resources, and it was good to browse them and learn more about what is on offer, thank you for posting and highlighting this feature Whit!]]></description>
