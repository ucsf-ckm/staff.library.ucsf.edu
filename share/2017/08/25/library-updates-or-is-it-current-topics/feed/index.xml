					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll take a stab at answering Ariel&#039;s good question! 

Comparing the two meetings, I see the main differences as:
-- Library Staff Meetings - less frequent, multiple agenda items of broad interest/value to all staff, large # of attendees
-- Library Updates - monthly, 1-2 reports, open to anyone who is interested in the topic

Given those different characteristics, I&#039;d say topics for staff meetings tend to be more informational, when you want to get the info out to as many staff as possible, but don&#039;t need to go in depth. Also good for topics that affect all of us, like planning, mission/vision/values discussion, website redesign, etc.

Library Updates provide a venue where we can go into a topic in more depth. There is ample time for questions and discussion. The topic may or may not be of broad interest. There is not an expectation that all staff would attend.

For example, I could see presenting the results of the space survey at the Staff Meeting. And presenting more details about that same project - methodology, in depth analysis of the data -  at a Library Update.

I&#039;m sure my examples and comparisons don&#039;t fit every scenario...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Since there will now be two library-wide monthly Friday events (coffee hour and Library Updates), can we make a general library-wide policy not to schedule other meetings on those days? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Kemi and Ariel, I am not sure if we can consolidate both meetings for now because there are quite a few meeting reports that take place, but you have given us something to think about. 

Ariel, that&#039;s a good question. I&#039;ll have to check in with Library Staff Meeting organizers to find out their criteria for selecting presentations so that we can help clarify this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great to see that the meetings are evolving! I would also like to see both meetings consolidated to one in the future. Not sure if that&#039;s possible logistically, but it may make for a simpler way to communicate all happenings, projects, and news among staff. 

Thank you Lisa!]]></description>
