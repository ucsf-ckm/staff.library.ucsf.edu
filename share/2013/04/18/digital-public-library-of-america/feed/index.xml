					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/staff.library.ucsf.edu/2013/04/18/digital-public-library-of-america/#comment-126&quot;&gt;Julia Kochi&lt;/a&gt;.

There was an announcement today that HathiTrust is partnering with DPLA, and we&#039;re members of HT.  Here&#039;s more info:

As announced today, HathiTrust Digital Library collections, including over 400,000 UC volumes, will be discoverable within the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) project.  Of HathiTrust&#039;s nearly 11 million volumes, the 3.5 million that are in the public domain or have been made publicly available by rights holders will become a DPLA &quot;content hub&quot;-accessible to DPLA users via the sharing of metadata records. HathiTrust will continue to host and preserve the digitized volumes.  In a major new development, OCLC has agreed to apply Creative Commons &quot;CC0&quot; licenses to the hosted UC catalog records, to remove barriers to providing the records within DPLA&#039;s data sharing agreement.

This new partnership emphasizes anew how the UC Libraries&#039; mass digitization collections form a core piece of the future digital library for all, via HathiTrust, and now DPLA.  For more information please see the official press release [http://dp.la/info/2013/06/18/hathitrust-to-partner-with-dpla/].]]></description>

There have been some discussions how UC (and thus CDL) might want to participate in DPLA but nothing concrete has been decided.  I think we have to decide how all the various parts fit together (local campus, UC collections, HathiTrust, etc.).  Stay tuned for more info!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m impressed that this has gone live so quickly. Will CDL be a partner, that is, will UC or UCSF be contributing any images?]]></description>
