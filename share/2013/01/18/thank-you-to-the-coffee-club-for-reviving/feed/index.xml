					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s the info again:

The tradition of the Library Coffee Hour is being revived! We’d like to invite all of you to share in some caffeinated (or, yes, decaf) conversation with your coworkers on the first Friday of every month. Coffee Hours will be from 10am-11am in the first floor Staff Lounge. Join us for coffee, tea, and treats!

Speaking of treats, we’d like to ask for volunteers to serve as co-hosts each month and bring in snacks for the group. Please sign-up on the wiki page for the month of your choice. We’ll be sure to send you a reminder email the week before. 

The first Coffee Hour will be Friday, February 1st. Mark your calendars! Looking forward to it!]]></description>
