					<description><![CDATA[Great job on getting this set up!  Thanks to you, Andy, Quincy, Bea, and John for figuring out the details and getting it done so quickly.  And thanks to Alan and Luis for their assistance in buying the books. I&#039;m sure the students will appreciate access to the ebooks.

For staff interested in seeing some of these new interactive ebooks, I&#039;d recommend taking a look at these titles.  Inkling does a great job and really utilizes interactive features fully.  These aren&#039;t your mother&#039;s ebooks!]]></description>
