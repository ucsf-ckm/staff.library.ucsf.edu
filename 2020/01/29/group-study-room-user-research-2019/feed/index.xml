That&#039;s a great suggestion, Andy! I agree that it would add an extra step if we were to check-out marker/eraser kits to groups and having them regularly replenished at the beginning of the week would remedy this need.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[FYI....we do offer markers (green, blue, black, red) and erasers at the front desk.  They do NOT have to be checked out like the dongles &#038; chargers.  Often times, students will come to the desk reporting there are no markers/eraser in the study room, and we just gladly hand them out.  I&#039;m not sure if checking out a bag of these items will make it easier for students and I think they will feel like &quot;it&#039;s just one more thing to worry about returning to the front desk&quot;.  One suggestion I have is for someone to replenish the rooms with markers/erasers regularly on a weekly basis (like every Sunday) so at least there&#039;s a good chance that rooms are better equipped during the first days of the week.  Walking around and putting markers in rooms shouldn&#039;t take very long I would think especially it&#039;s relatively quieter on weekends than weekdays.]]></description>
